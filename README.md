# Craps
Text base version of Craps

This program allows a player to play a simple game of craps.

A simple game of craps is defined as playing either the pass or don't pass line.  A simple game of craps does not include playing any other bet on the table.

As of right now, if a player wins/loses on the come out roll the results are displayed immediately.

If the shooter establishes a point, a pause is coded within the function that keeps rolling the dice.  The pause is randomly selected from a period of 1 to 5 seconds.  The idea is to add some suspense as the game is played and allow the player to follow what is happening.  I like showing the player the result of subsequent rolls, but without the pause, all the results appearing at once was at times information overload if the shooter rolled more than 5 or 6 times before hitting the point or crapping out.

I am working to include the code to allow a pass/don't pass line better to take/lay odds.

Also, I know there is bloat/inefficiencies in the code now. Also, the text is disjointed jumping between "shooter" and "player" 

Once everything is working like I want it to, I'll work on optimizing the code and cleaning up the text.

Features I want to add:
  1. allowing player to take/lay odds
  2. display dice.
  3. ???
