# Craps
Text base version of Craps

This program allows a player to play a simple game of craps.

A simple game of craps is defined as playing either the pass or don't pass line.

A simple game of craps does not include playing any other bet on the table.

I am working to include the code to allow a pass/don't pass line better to take/lay odds.

Also, I know there is bloat/inefficiencies in the code now. Also, the text is disjointed jumping between "shooter" and "player" 

Once everything is working like I want it to, I'll work on optimizing the code and cleaning up the text.

Features I want to add:
  1. allowing player to take/lay odds
  2. display dice.
  3. ???
